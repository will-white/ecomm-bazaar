/**
 * Case-insensitively compare a column to a pattern,
 * which can include `%` and `_`
 * characters to match multiple variations. Including `%`
 * in the pattern matches zero or more characters, and including
 * `_` will match a single character.
 *
 * Unlike like, this performs a case-insensitive comparison.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ```ts
 * // Select all cars with 'Turbo' in their names.
 * db.select().from(cars)
 *   .where(ilike(cars.name, '%Turbo%'))
 * ```
 *
 * @see like for a case-sensitive version of this condition
